### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I have 20+ years at the intersection of software engineering, data science, machine learning and product leadership. Unfortunately, my work has been proprietary and I don't have time for much open-source work. See below for a summary of my background and keep reading on potential collaborations for start-ups/products!

- Trusted advisor and consultant to executives in many industries 
- Python, R, Julia, JavaScript lover (equally, like my kids :-D)
- Hobbies: running, lifting, hockey, and self-defense (krav maga)
